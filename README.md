# PullOver-Pro
Multitasking Drawer tweak for jailbroken iOS devices

## About

PullOver Pro is multitasking substrate / jailbreak / runtime  extension written in Objective - C. It adds a small handle, or grabber, to the side of your device, allowing you to "pin" any application, giving you access from anywhere on your device.

I no longer actively maintain these tweaks, however, I will do my best to answer questions and provide direction to anyone interested in contributing, or just generally curious about the software.
